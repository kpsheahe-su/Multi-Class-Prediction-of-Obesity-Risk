Particpating in the Kaggle Multi-Class-Prediction-of-Obesity-Risk Data Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e2/overview), I created a machine learning model that aimed to accurately predict if a person had obesity. The competition lasted a few weeks and involved working with synthetic datasets to solve machine learning challenges. Using basic modeling and visualization techniques, I explored the dataset and attempted to improve my predictive performance. Overall, it was a standard competition experience where I aimed to learn and refine my skills in data science.

These are my rankings among the other competitors:
2180th Place in the Public Leaderboard (80% of your submitted predictions data. Once the competition has closed)
1214th Place in the Private Leaderboard (20% of your submitted predictions data. Preliminary view while the competition is open)
